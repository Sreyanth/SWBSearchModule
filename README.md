===============

These are the files I have added (or worked with) to the spectral-workbench (see: github.com/Sreyanth/spectral-workbench, forked from: github.com/jywarren/spectral-workbench)

Some files which I didnt even edit might have also been included, to make sense of the edits.

All the changes in this repo till date have been merged in the working main repo (see Sreyanth/spectral-workbench). Please note that the development of spectral-workbench occurs at jywarren/spectral-workbench
