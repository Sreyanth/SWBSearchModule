===============

These are the files I have added (or worked with) to the spectral-workbench (see: github.com/Sreyanth/spectral-workbench, forked from: github.com/jywarren/spectral-workbench)

Some files which I didnt even edit might have also been included, to make sense of the edits.

All the changes in this repo till date have been merged in the working main repo (see Sreyanth/spectral-workbench). Please note that the development of spectral-workbench occurs at jywarren/spectral-workbench

PS: Added some code in 'initial_attempts' folder which may be of some use for people who are looking to work on Image resizing and stuff. Only the code in 'webserver' folder is the final one.
